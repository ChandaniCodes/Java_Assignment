Question :
Admin adds new regulations and assigns them to the department manually.
Department Head will send these regulations to the individual users through the mail to get their consent. 
Users will send their comments through the courier service after reading regulations. 
Department head has to collect the user inputs and will have to pass it on to Admin. 
As a lot of manual workflow is involved, it takes a lot of time for Admin to close each regulation. 
Therefore, a new system is required to automate this regulation creation and closure process.
